Coding problems daily submit repo

This repository is used for the daily submit of the solutions to coding problems and data challenges.

Each platform has a separate personal directory. In the directory, several files should be included. In principle, each file should be the solution for a single leetcode problem/data challenge. However, the following conditions can be excluded:

Multiple solutions in a file
Problems of the same type in a file (e.g. LC198--House Robber and LC213--House Robber II )
for each solution, the following should be included:

* Which problem is this solution trying to solve. Format should be: LC xxx--name (e.g. LC 264--ugly number II )
* This applied to leetcode solutions: Briefly explain the algorithm, at lease should contain time complexity and space complexity. If the solution is from the internet, please attach the link
* This applied to leetcode solutions: The excution time and rank of the algorithm. You can find this after your solution is accepted by leetcode
* This applied to data challenge solutions: explain the solution in a substaintial manner, including the demonstration of each step.
* This applied to data challenge solutions: include a next-step plan or a brief description about possible improvements/problems the solution may have.

Wish you good luck!
